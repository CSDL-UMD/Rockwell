# twauth-web

A simple Python + Flask web app that demonstrates the flow of obtaining a [Twitter user OAuth access token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth).

## Setup

1. Obtain consumer key and secret from the Twitter Developer portal. The app should be configured to enable Sign in with Twitter. See `twauth-web.py` for more details, but you can either:
   1. add these values to a `config.cfg` file (local deployment); or
   2. set environment variables `TWAUTH_APP_CONSUMER_KEY` and `TWAUTH_APP_CONSUMER_SECRET` (cloud deployment)
2. Setup a [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment, and install dependencies:
   1. `pipenv install`
   2. `pipenv shell`
3. Start the app:
   1. `python3 ./twauth-web.py`; or
   2. `gunicorn twauth-web:app`

> Note: the app must have an Internet-accessible URL - do not attempt to connect via localhost, as this will not work. You can run a tunnel e.g. `ngrok` for local use, or deploy to a cloud platform such as Heroku (a `Procfile` is included).

Open a browser window on your demo app's external URL. Don't click the buttons yet!

Finally, revisit the dev portal, and add your app's callback URL (`https://your-deployed-url/callback`) to the callback URL whitelist setting. Once saved, follow the instructions on the app's web UI to click through the demo pages.
